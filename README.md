# Ashes of Time

**Survive the apocalypse daily in this resource manager.**  
Face unique AI challenges, make choices, manage survivors, hunt via QTEs, and fight to see another dawn.

> _Inspired by games like **60 Seconds!** and **Oregon Trail**, this project uses the **Google Gemini API** to create dynamic, thematic survival scenarios._

## How to Play

- **Goal:**  
  Survive as many days as possible in the bunker.

- **Resources:**  
  Manage your **Food** and **Water**. Running out ends the game. Survivors consume resources daily.

- **Survivors:**  
  Monitor party **Health** and **Statuses**. If your health (as the player) drops to zero, the game ends.

- **Daily Events:**  
  Each day presents a new **Situation** generated by AI. Read the scenario and choose an Action.

- **Choices:**  
  Decisions impact resources, health, statuses, and can lead to finding **items**, **companions**, or **new survivors**.

- **Hunting:**  
  Use the **Go Hunting** action (if available) to gather food via a **QTE mini-game**.  
  Select a hunterâ€”but beware of the health risks!
